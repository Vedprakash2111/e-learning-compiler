# E-Learning Platform with Integrated Code Compiler

## 1. Problem Statement
Traditional e-learning platforms focus on video lectures and quizzes but lack real-time coding environments. This makes it difficult for students to practice coding concepts interactively, leading to distractions and loss of learning continuity as they switch between platforms.

## 2. Aim of the Project
Design and develop a web-based e-learning platform that enables users to learn programming concepts, practice coding within the same environment, and receive instant feedback through an integrated online code compiler.

## 3. Objectives
- Create an online portal for coding tutorials and lessons.
- Integrate a real-time code editor supporting multiple programming languages (Python, C++, Java, etc.).
- Instantly evaluate student submissions using the Judge0 API.
- Implement authentication, progress tracking, and leaderboards.
- Provide quizzes and assignments for skill assessment.

## 4. Scope of the Project
- **Users:** Students, teachers, administrators
- **Features:** Registration, tutorial access, coding practice, submission evaluation, leaderboard
- **Platform:** Web-based (responsive for desktop & mobile)
- **Future Enhancements:** AI-based code feedback, plagiarism detection, gamification, group projects, contests

## 5. System Architecture / Flow

### A. User Flow
1. User signs up or logs in.
2. User selects a programming topic and views the lesson.
3. User writes and executes code in the built-in editor.
4. Backend sends code to Judge0 API for compilation and execution.
5. Results are returned and displayed instantly.
6. User earns points and climbs the leaderboard.

### B. System Components
- **Frontend (React / Next.js):** UI for learning, coding, and quizzes; code editor (Monaco/CodeMirror)
- **Backend (Node.js/Express or Django):** Manages users, lessons, submissions; communicates with Judge0 API
- **Database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL):** Stores users, lessons, quizzes, results, rankings
- **External API (Judge0):** Secure code compilation and execution
- **Deployment:** Vercel/Netlify (frontend), Render/Railway (backend), MongoDB Atlas/PostgreSQL Cloud
